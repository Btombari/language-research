# SQL
Structured Query Language (SQL) is a language designed for managing and working with data in a relational database management system. The original version, called SEQUEL (Structured English Query Language), was developed at IBM in the 70s by a research team working on a relational database model. The database and language were never officially released, but the language became very popular. It became commercially available in the 1979 version of Oracle's RDMS.

### Purpose
SQL is both a data definition language and a data manipulation language. It is mostly declarative, but also includes procedural elements such as control blocks, control flow and boolean operators. Some database vendors also include procedural extensions to the standard SQL language for their database systems, but the ANSI SQL version also includes SQL/PSM for procedural elements. It is a high-level (4GL), and the database engine parses the language, performs optimization, and then executes the statements. It appears to work very similar to a Java or C#, with an intermediate language that is executed, instead of a pure interpreted situation.

It uses global and block scoping.
It is strongly typed.
