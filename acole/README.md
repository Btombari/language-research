### History
Ruby is a language of careful balance. Its creator, Yukihiro “Matz” Matsumoto, blended parts of his favorite languages (Perl, Smalltalk, Eiffel, Ada, and Lisp) to form a new language that balanced functional programming with imperative programming.

He has often said that he is “trying to make Ruby natural, not simple,” in a way that mirrors life.

### Code Samples

```Ruby
# Recursion Example code:

def countdown(n)
  return if n.zero? # base case
  puts n
  countdown(n-1)    # getting closer to base case 
end
